A particularly exciting use case I think of AI for science is its application to computational materials science. I'm a graduate student in computational materials science and I'm quite biased in that sense, but recent talks I attended and how quickly I witness it's being adopted into this field is certainly very exciting. 

There are many possible things to do in this application field. Namely, coming up with force fields for molecules and atoms, learning complex potential energy surfaces in high dimensional spaces, learning new Hamiltonians or entire density functionals in density functional theory. There could be applications in surface science to model surface roughness. Usually a big problem in computational materials science is how small the size of the model you can feasibly use. AI can help us learn from smaller models and extrapolate findings onto larger ones without the need for overly complex physics based models to understand the complex scaling laws onto larger sizes. It can have profound effects in Quantum Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations.

It also has a lot of pitfalls I think that could potentially hinder its quick adoption. Evaluating the error bars coming from AI extremely difficult, and we usually have no idea how reliable they are. They're usually trained on data available using public databases of materials, which, to be honest, they have their problems despite many rounds of testing. They might not be the most accurate themselves, the codes used to generate such data might not be easily available, leading to transparency and reproducibility problems. 

People float the idea of general broad applicability as a potential way to evaluate the success of AI models. Yet it still runs into problems. Data on some systems such as semiconductors are more easily available since there's simply more research done for them. An AI model trained on semiconductors is not necessarily going to do very well on more complex materials such as oxides. Similarly, training AI models on larger systems such as Moire crystals could prove to be a challenge. 

Still, the benchmarking and evaluation that one thinks of very easily is to always compare with experimental results, as is done with other non-AI based models in computational materials science. Even then, there's usually a lack of data problem. Not all materials systems are carefully measured for every single property they have. The field is still very young and there's a lot of more work to be done to figure out the difficulties associated with how to even evaluate and measure the success and reliability of AI-based models.
